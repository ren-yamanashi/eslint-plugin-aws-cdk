# Introduction

This is an ESLint plugin for the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

This plugin allows you to check your AWS CDK code with ESLint.  
For example, it can check for the following:

- Syntax errors
- Violations of AWS CDK best practices

Integrating ESLint with your editor is also convenient for checking code in real-time.
